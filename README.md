# Improving Data Accuracy in CRM using AI

## Overview
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems store vast amounts of customer data, but inaccuracies in data can lead to poor decision-making, inefficiencies, and lost revenue. This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance data accuracy in a CRM by detecting inconsistencies, filling missing values, and automating data validation processes.

## Features
- **Data Cleansing**: Identifies and corrects inaccurate or duplicate entries.
- **Automated Data Validation**: Uses AI to validate incoming data in real-time.
- **Predictive Data Filling**: Fills missing fields using machine learning models.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detects irregularities in customer data to prevent errors.
- **Data Standardization**: Ensures uniform formatting for better usability.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **AI/ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL
- **CRM Integration**: APIs for Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho CRM
- **Cloud Services**: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalability



## Usage
1. **Upload CRM Data**: Connect your CRM and import data.
2. **AI Processing**: The AI model will clean, validate, and improve data accuracy.
3. **Export Clean Data**: The processed data can be exported back to the CRM.
4. **Monitor Reports**: Review accuracy reports and detected anomalies.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement NLP for detecting incorrect customer names and addresses.
- AI-based auto-suggestions for incomplete data.
- Integration with more CRM platforms.
